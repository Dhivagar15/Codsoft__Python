Simple Calculator - TASK 2
The Simple Calculator performs basic arithmetic operations. Users can input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, floor division or power). Here's how it works:

User Input:

The user is prompted to input two numbers.
They also select an operation (e.g., + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division,% for modulus,// for floor division, ** for power).
Perform Calculation:

Based on the user's input, the application performs the chosen arithmetic operation.
For example:
If the user inputs 5, 3, and selects +, the result is 8.
If the user inputs 10, 4, and selects -, the result is 6.
If the user inputs 7, 2, and selects *, the result is 14.
If the user inputs 15, 5, and selects /, the result is 3.0.
If the user inputs 5, 5, and selects %, the result is 0.0.
If the user inputs 15, 5, and selects //, the result is 3.0.
If the user inputs 3, 2, and selects **, the result is 9.0.
Display Result:

The calculated result is displayed on the screen.

Password Generator - TASK 3
The Password Generator creates strong and random passwords based on user specifications. Users can specify the desired password length and complexity. Here's how it works:

User Input:

The user is prompted to specify the desired length of the password.
For example, the user might input a length of 12 characters.
Generate Password:

The application generates a password by combining random characters.
The characters can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols.
The complexity of the password depends on the user's preferences.
For example, a generated password might look like: R7#kT9p$JfXz
Display the Password:

The generated password is displayed on the screen.
Users can then use this strong password for their accounts, ensuring better security.
